This repository contains an array of keyboard layouts I have created with [Ukelele](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele).

To install them on a Mac, simply copy each file into "/Library/Keyboard Layouts/" and restart your computer.


### Esperanto - Colemak

A simple Esperanto Colemak layout. Each special character is mapped with `option` and/or `Shift`.

### Hebrew - Colemak

A simple Hebrew Colemak layout. I did not use any guide here, so maybe not all mappings are logical.
